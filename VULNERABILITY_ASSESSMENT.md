# Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive assessment of potential security vulnerabilities identified in the Cambrian Climate Club website application, a React TypeScript application built with Vite.

## Application Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18.x with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom styling
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Simple Express server serving static files

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. Client-Side Data Exposure
**Severity**: Low to Medium

**Description**: The application stores all data (member information, projects, achievements, etc.) statically within the client-side bundle in `/src/data/content.ts`. This makes sensitive information publicly accessible to anyone who inspects the source code.

**Affected Files**:
- `/src/data/content.ts`

**Risk**: Personal information such as names, IDs, class information, and campus locations are exposed in the client-side code.

### 2. Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion Risk
**Severity**: Medium

**Description**: The application uses image paths that reference local files (e.g., `/people/Md. Motammim Bin Arif.jpg`, `/images/Club logo.png`). While these are hardcoded in the source, if any dynamic path construction were to be implemented later, it could lead to path traversal attacks.

**Affected Files**:
- `/src/data/content.ts` (contains hardcoded image paths)
- `/src/components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx` (handles image rendering)

### 3. Input Validation Issues
**Severity**: Low

**Description**: The Counter component in `/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` accepts an `end` prop without proper validation. Although the current implementation checks for zero values, it lacks comprehensive validation for extremely large numbers which could cause performance issues.

**Affected Code**:
```javascript
const Counter: React.FC<{ end: number; duration?: number; 'data-testid'?: string }> = ({ end, duration = 2000, 'data-testid': testId }) => {
  // ...
  const increment = end > start ? 1 : -1;
  const stepTime = Math.abs(Math.floor(duration / range));
  // Potential issue: Very large 'end' values could create many intervals
}
```

### 4. Server Security Concerns
**Severity**: Medium

**Description**: The Express server in `/server.js` implements very basic security measures:
- No rate limiting
- No CORS configuration
- No helmet middleware for security headers
- No input sanitization (though currently just serves static files)

**Affected File**:
- `/server.js`

### 5. Information Disclosure
**Severity**: Low

**Description**: The application exposes internal identifiers (like member IDs in the format "Cam-CC-XXXXX") which could provide insights into the organization's internal structure and member counts.

**Examples**:
- `Cam-CC-240001` (indicating likely ~2400+ members registered in 2024)

### 6. Dependency Security
**Severity**: Unknown (Could not audit)

**Description**: Unable to run `npm audit` due to system resource constraints. The application uses several dependencies that should be checked for known vulnerabilities:
- express: ^4.18.2
- react-router-dom: ^6.24.1
- framer-motion: ^11.3.1
- Other dependencies listed in package.json

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement proper authentication/authorization** if any sensitive member information needs to be protected
2. **Add security headers** to the Express server using Helmet.js
3. **Configure CORS properly** if API endpoints are added later
4. **Add rate limiting** to the server to prevent abuse

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Validate numeric inputs** in components like Counter to prevent performance issues
2. **Sanitize and validate all user-provided data** (though currently the app doesn't appear to accept user input beyond navigation)
3. **Consider moving sensitive data to a backend API** instead of exposing it in client-side bundles

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Implement a proper backend API** with authentication for managing member data
2. **Add CSRF protection** if forms are added
3. **Regular dependency updates** and security audits
4. **Input sanitization** if any dynamic content features are added

## Additional Notes
- The application appears to be primarily a static informational website with no user authentication or dynamic content submission
- Most vulnerabilities are related to data exposure rather than active attack vectors
- The simple architecture reduces the attack surface compared to complex applications with databases and user accounts
- The application uses modern frameworks with good security practices built-in, but additional hardening would improve security posture

## Conclusion
While the application doesn't handle highly sensitive data or implement complex functionality that would create many attack vectors, there are several areas where security could be improved, particularly around data exposure and server configuration. The most critical concern is the exposure of personal information in client-side code.
